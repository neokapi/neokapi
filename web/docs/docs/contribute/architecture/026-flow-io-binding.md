## Summary

A flow is a **pure transformation over a stream of Blocks** backed by a
block-store session. *Where content enters* (the **source binding**) and *where
results go* (the **sink binding**) are resolved from invocation context, not
encoded in the flow graph. The same flow definition runs unchanged whether its
content comes from a file read, the `.klz` workspace cache, the project block
store, or an imported interchange file — and whether its results are written to
a file, committed as overlays to the store, or both.

A sink is **optional**. A *process-only* run lands its work as overlays in the
project / `.klz` and emits no file; materialization is a separate, later sink
operation (`merge` / `export` / `pack`). This makes the `.klz` lifecycle
first-class: `extract` (source → store), `run` / transform (store → store),
`merge` (store → file).

The leading **source-transform stage** ([AD-004](004-processing-engine.md))
splits into two kinds: *idempotent model-settling transforms* that run **once at
ingest** and persist to the store, and *round-trip-paired brackets*
(redact … unredact) that stay part of a **run's** source/sink wiring.

Bindings are named by one scheme vocabulary across the CLI, the flow document,
and the existing resource URIs. A concrete binding resolves by precedence —
explicit flag, then project / `.klz` context, then the flow's intent, then
auto-detection — and `kapi run --explain` always shows the resolved
`source → sink` so nothing is hidden. A flow declares only *intrinsic intent*
(`sink: none` for an analysis flow), never a path.

## Context

The runtime executor is **already** source/sink-agnostic. `DefaultExecutor`
(`core/flow/executor.go`) knows nothing about readers or writers — it wires
channels between tools, opens a `blockstore.Session`, and commits or rolls it
back. Reader and writer are attached *externally* by `FileRunner`
(`core/flow/filerunner.go`), which performs `read file → feed parts → executor →
drain → write file`.

The mismatch lives one layer up, in **authoring**:

- The flow graph bakes I/O into the model. `FlowDefinition` has explicit
  `NodeReader` / `NodeWriter` node types (`core/flow/definition.go`), and
  `StepsSpec` has `input:` / `output:` fields whose reader/writer nodes are
  *auto-inserted* around the steps (`core/flow/steps.go`, `StepsToGraph`). So the
  model a human (or the flow editor) authors against assumes a file is read and a
  file is written.

The `.klz` package ([AD-025](025-klf-package.md)) introduced content that does
**not** originate from a fresh file read:

- A workspace run reads existing blocks and prior overlays from a persistent
  per-source block store. Today `cli/klzworkspace.go` reuses `FileRunner.RunFile`
  with the cache's extracted source bytes *plus* a `Store` side-channel — the
  `reader` node still re-parses the original format each run while the real
  working state enters through a side door.
- `merge` has **no incoming content at all** — it hydrates `targets/<locale>`
  overlays. It is implemented as a synthetic `"merge"` flow whose only tool is a
  `hydrateTargetsTool` (`cli/klzhydrate.go`). The `NodeReader` concept is
  conceptually wrong here: the input *is* the cached blocks.

Two questions this AD settles:

1. Is read → process → write the right shape, or should source and sink be
   **context-wired ends** — `Start → {flow} → End`?
2. Must every run produce an output, or can a run be **process-only**, landing
   its work in the store?

## Decision

### 1. The flow is the middle; source and sink are bindings

A flow operates only on a stream of Parts backed by a session. The endpoints are
a small, separate **binding** vocabulary, resolved from invocation context:

| Binding | Source role (in) | Sink role (out) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | `DataFormatReader` over file bytes | `DataFormatWriter` + skeleton round-trip ([AD-005](005-format-system.md)) |
| `store` / `klz` | existing blocks + overlays from a persistent store | commit overlays — no materialization |
| `import` / `export` | overlays landed from an interchange file ([AD-017](017-bilingual-format-interop.md)) | emit interchange (XLIFF / PO / TMX / TBX) |
| `none` | — | discard (observation/metrics only) |

The defining property: **a flow definition is identical across bindings.** The
same `ai-translate-qa` flow runs in the file CLI, against a `.klz` workspace, and
against a project — only the binding differs.

### 2. Reader and writer stop being graph nodes

`input:` / `output:` are promoted **out of** `StepsSpec.steps` into a top-level
`source:` / `sink:` spec, and `NodeReader` / `NodeWriter` cease to be tool-graph
nodes. The `file` binder remains the **default**, so an unqualified
`kapi run flow -i file.json -o out.json` is unchanged — it is sugar for
`source: file`, `sink: file`. `FileRunner` becomes **one binder among several**
behind a common binder interface; the klz workspace's store wiring and the
synthetic merge flow collapse into `source: store` + `sink: file`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: FlowDefinition
metadata:
  name: Production Pipeline
spec:
  source: file        # default; or `store`, `klz`, `import:xliff`
  sink: store         # process-only: commit overlays, emit nothing
  steps:
    - tool: tm-leverage
    - tool: ai-translate
    - tool: qa-check
```

### 3. Sink is optional → process-only runs

A run whose `sink` is `store` (or absent) commits its overlays to the project /
`.klz` block store and **emits no file**. Materialization becomes a distinct sink
operation — `merge` (store → file via skeleton), `export` (store → interchange),
or `pack` (store → `.klz`). This separates *doing the work* from *handing it
out*, and makes the workspace lifecycle the natural grain:

```
extract  sources → store        (source: file,  sink: store)
run/xfm  store   → store         (source: store, sink: store)   ← process-only
merge    store   → files         (source: store, sink: file)
```

Because the block store is append-only and content-addressed, a process-only run
is **idempotent and resumable**: re-running skips work whose overlay already
exists, anchored to the current block hashes ([AD-025](025-klf-package.md) §5).
The store *is* the workspace.

### 4. Split the source-transform stage

The leading source-transform stage ([AD-004](004-processing-engine.md)) settles
a single canonical model before the main tools run. In a workspace world its two
uses pull apart:

- **Ingest-time settlers** — *idempotent, model-settling* transforms
  (segmentation, normalization) belong to **bringing content into the store**,
  not to each flow. They run **once at ingest** and persist as overlays; later
  flows see the settled model and never recompute it. This removes redundant
  per-run work and the drift hazard of re-settling the canonical model on every
  run.
- **Run brackets** — *paired, policy-bearing* transforms (redact … unredact,
  [AD-020](020-redaction.md)) bracket a single run and may vary per run or
  provider. They stay part of the **run's** source/sink wiring: the `Start`
  redacts the source binding, the `End` restores in the sink binding. The
  built-in `secure-translate` flow (redact · ai-translate · unredact) is exactly
  this `Start(redact) → {translate} → End(unredact)` shape.

A transform that is genuinely both (idempotent *and* recoverable) may be declared
at ingest; the run-bracket form is reserved for transforms whose restore must
happen inside the run.

### 5. Resolving a binding across the CLI and flow surfaces

A binding is named by the same small scheme vocabulary (§1) on every surface —
the CLI, the flow document, and the resource URIs the tool resolver already
understands (`tm:`, `termbase:`, `srx:` in `core/flow/resolve.go`). This mirrors
two conventions a user already knows: *detect-by-extension with an explicit
override* (as in format-converting tools) and *scheme-prefixed endpoints* (as in
file-sync tools).

**Precedence.** A concrete binding is resolved from the first source that names
one, in order: an explicit CLI flag, the project / `.klz` context, the flow's
declared intent, then auto-detection. `kapi run --explain` prints the resolved
`source → sink` and executes nothing, so the chosen binding is always visible
rather than inferred.

**The CLI carries the locator; bare paths are detected, schemes are explicit.**
`-i` / `-o` accept either a plain path or a `scheme:` locator. A plain path is
bound by detection — its extension or kind decides it (`.klz` → the workspace
store, `.xliff` / `.po` → interchange, a plain document → `file`, a directory
inside a project → the project store). A `scheme:` locator forces the binding and
removes any ambiguity: `-o store:` is the block store, while `-o l10n/` is a
directory of files. `file:` forces a path that would otherwise read as a scheme.
Each example below shows the resolved `source → sink`:

```bash
kapi run translate -i a.json -o b.json          # file(a.json)    → file(b.json)
kapi run translate -i a.json                     # file(a.json)    → store        (in a project: process-only)
kapi run translate -i work.klz                   # store(work.klz) → store        (.klz transformed in place)
kapi run translate -i work.klz --pack            # store(work.klz) → store, then ejected to the .klz
kapi run translate -i store: -o xliff:hand.xliff # store           → interchange(hand.xliff)
kapi run qa-check  -i a.json -o none             # file(a.json)    → none         (analysis; report only)
kapi extract src/*.json -o work.klz              # file(glob)      → store(work.klz)
kapi merge -o l10n/{lang}/{name}.{ext}           # store           → file(template)
```

`extract`, `merge`, and `pack` are named presets for the bindings their names
imply; `run` is the general form. All resolve through the same precedence and
report the same `--explain` line.

**The flow declares intent, never a location.** A flow document carries a binding
only when it is *intrinsic to what the flow is*, and then only the *kind* — never
a path or a concrete store. A translation flow materializes, so it leaves its
sink unset and lets the invocation place the result; an analysis or QA flow
inherently produces no document, so it declares `sink: none`; a flow that only
makes sense over an existing workspace may declare `source: store`.

```yaml
# A translate flow: binding-agnostic. The ends come from where it is run.
spec:
  steps:
    - tool: tm-leverage
    - tool: ai-translate
    - tool: qa-check
```

```yaml
# A QA flow: intrinsically process-only. It never emits a document, anywhere.
spec:
  sink: none
  steps:
    - tool: qa-check
```

Because a flow's only binding is intrinsic intent, there is no per-flow output
path for a reader to be surprised by; the same flow document runs over a loose
file, a `.klz` workspace, or a project without edit, and `--explain` shows where
a given run's content actually lands.

**In a project, a run lands in the store.** When a `.kapi` recipe is in scope, a
run with no explicit sink commits its work as overlays to the project block store
and emits no document. Materializing the localized files is a separate, explicit
step (`kapi merge`). The store is the working copy: a re-run reuses the overlays
already present and recomputes only what changed
([AD-025](025-klf-package.md) §5).

## Consequences

- A flow definition is portable across origins: the same flow runs in the file
  CLI, a `.klz` workspace, and a project, because it only ever sees a session of
  Blocks.
- The synthetic `"merge"` flow, the `hydrateTargetsTool`, and the `Store`
  side-channel in `cli/klzworkspace.go` collapse into ordinary `source` / `sink`
  bindings.
- Process-only runs make incremental, resumable workflows the default rather than
  a special case; materialization is deferred and explicit.
- `kapi run flow -i file.json -o out.json` is unchanged — the `file` binder is
  the default, so there is no CLI regression.
- Ingest-time settling removes per-run segmentation/normalization recomputation
  and keeps the canonical model stable across a project's lifetime.
- The flow editor surfaces source/sink as **endpoint pickers** (file · store ·
  import/export · none), not arbitrary reader/writer nodes; capability gating for
  the source-transform stage ([AD-002](002-content-model.md) overlays,
  segmentation) is unaffected.
- The runtime executor is unchanged — it already binds nothing. This is a model,
  naming, and glue refactor, not an engine rewrite.
- One scheme vocabulary spans the CLI locator, the flow document, and the tool
  resolver, so a binding reads the same wherever it appears. Bare paths keep the
  zero-ceremony common case; `scheme:` is the unambiguous escape hatch.
- A documented precedence plus `--explain` keeps the resolved binding visible, so
  layered defaults (flow intent under project context under an explicit flag) do
  not become hidden configuration.
